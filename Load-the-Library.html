<!-- 
When to Load the Library
	While it is common in HTML applications to place scripts at the end of the <body> element, it is recommended that you load the AngularJS library either in the <head> or at the start of the <body>.

	This is because calls to angular.module can only be compiled after the library has been loaded. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script src="angular.min.js"></script>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
	{{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
</div>

<script>
	var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
	app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
	    $scope.firstName = "John";
	    $scope.lastName = "Doe";
	});
</script>

</body>
</html>
